1. add right hand panel to environmental setup, add border effect on other tabs
2. add tab before Environment setup that gives three paths of Windows Raw, WSL, and Docker then once decided, make the other tabs hidden then have next tab (Environment Setup) depend on the choice made on this Second Tab (the Righteous path on King Gates' Road of Windows Native, the Portal to the Negative Zone with WSL, or Astral Projection to Saturn in the belly of the whale )
3. After #2, do full Environment Setup for Raw and WSL, leave Docker method for later
4. Do more with checking current version, retrieving LTS version and checks for if WSL is setup/activated and maybe showing a list of version options somehow, maybe some API available then display versions
5. Sequence tab reveals until steps 2 and 3 are done completely and try to create animation to give it significance.
6. How to get folder structure worked in there for sake of wallet tracking/aliasing/selecting/switching quickly
7. When wallet selected, how to make cool graphic of it, looking SNES/Genesis
